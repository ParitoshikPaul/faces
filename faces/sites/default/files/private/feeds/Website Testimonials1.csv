FACES GO CHIC LIPSTICK,The lipstick color is amazingly pretty! It is somewhere between orange and red but definitely more on the red side. Two swatches are more than enough and no touch up is required for hours. Even when the lipstick fades.. It stains your lips so there is a subtle color on the lips. A total YAY,By Shivani
FACES EYE PENCIL,These are a must-have in every girls vanity. One of the best colour pencils I have ever come across.,By Riz
FACES EYE PENCIL,"This is the best eye pencil I've ever used. It's creamy and glides on your lids like butter. I have the shade metallic brown which is a nice pigmented brown with a metallic sheen that makes it more interesting. 
Highly recommended product.",By Paromita
FACES ULTIME PRO VELVET MATTE LIPSTICK,"Faces is a brand that is known for providing the best quality products at budget price. I wanted to purchase a lipstick that would survive my office hours, as I normally do not have the time to touch up repeatedly. I purchased the Fig shade from the range, as I like subtle colors. Not only the color is beautiful and pigmented, but is comfortable to wear too, unlike many matte lip colors that are too dry. It stays for around 4 to 5 hours, after which one touch up is all that I need for the whole day. Another gem from Faces.",By Vanya
FACES KAJAL,"Faces kajal is soft, smooth textured kohl, packaged in a sturdy travel friendly casing provided with a mirror for touch ups. The pigmentation is very good – dark and black, comparable to MAC Smolder. The best part is that it stays put and does not give me raccoon eyes; the smudging is minimal which can be taken care of with a tissue. I’d recommend this to everyone! I love this kajal and it is my HG kajal now. ",By Ankita Chaturvedi
