						<h3>Five generations of fine confections</h3>
						<p>Flurys the legendary tearoom in Kolkata’s fashionable Park Streetwas founded in 1927 by Mr.and
						Mrs. J Flurys. Presenting fine European traditional confections, it had soon become a popular
						meeting place for all ages. It introduced the city and many generations to authentic Swiss and
						as the only tea room, the place was known far and wide for its exotic cakes, creamy pastries, rich
						puddings and perhaps the best Swiss chocolates outside the European continent, and in no small
						measure to the relaxed and cheerful atmosphere that it has always provided.
						Flurys is now open with a fresh design that recalls the 1930s, yet.</p>
